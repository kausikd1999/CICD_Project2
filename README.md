DevOps CI/CD Pipeline Project

Overview
	•	Welcome to the CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) project powered by GitHub, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, and more. This project aims to streamline the development, testing, and deployment processes of applications using modern DevOps practices. By leveraging containerization, orchestration, and monitoring tools, we ensure efficient delivery and operational excellence.
 
Key Technologies Used:
	•	GitHub: Hosts the source code repository and manages version control.
	•	Jenkins: Orchestrates the CI/CD pipelines, automating builds, tests, and deployments.
	•	Docker: Provides containerization for consistent and reproducible environments.
	•	Kubernetes: Manages containerized applications, ensuring scalability and resilience.
	•	SonarQube: Ensures code quality through static code analysis.
	•	Nexus: Acts as an artifact repository for storing and managing build artifacts.
	•	Prometheus: Monitors and collects metrics from applications and infrastructure.
	•	Grafana: Visualizes metrics collected by Prometheus, enabling effective monitoring.

Features:
	•	Automated Builds: Triggered on code commits to GitHub, Jenkins automates the build process, ensuring consistent and reliable builds.
	•	Continuous Deployment: Deploy Dockerized applications to Kubernetes clusters, facilitating rapid and controlled deployments.
	•	Monitoring and Metrics: Utilize Prometheus and Grafana to monitor application performance, track metrics, and set up alerts for proactive management.

 Purpose:
	•	This project aims to enhance development agility and operational efficiency by integrating robust CI/CD pipelines with Kubernetes orchestration and comprehensive monitoring. It enables teams to iterate faster, maintain high code quality, and deliver reliable applications to production seamlessly.
